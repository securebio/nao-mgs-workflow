# Style Guide For Code Review for `nao-mgs-workflow`

- In addition to core code changes, you should also review changes to CI/CD specified in the `.github` directory.
- All PRs should modify `CHANGELOG.md` to summarize the changes made in the PR. If this is not the case, you should suggest appropriate, concise additions to `CHANGELOG.md` to document the changes made.
- Always review documentation in the `docs` folder to ensure it has been kept up to date with relevant code changes. If this is not the case, you should suggest concise additions and modifications to keep the documentation useful to users.
