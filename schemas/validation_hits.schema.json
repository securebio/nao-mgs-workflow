  "description": "Per-read viral hit assignments with post-hoc BLAST validation results, as produced by the DOWNSTREAM workflow. Each row represents a single putative viral read. The `aligner_*` columns are inherited from the RUN workflow, where reads are aligned by Bowtie2 (short-read) or Minimap2 (ONT) and then processed into per-read summary statistics; LCA and score statistics are calculated post-hoc across all alignments for each read. Reference sequences are partitioned into three subsets: natural (non-artificial NCBI sequences, unsuffixed columns), artificial (descendants of NCBI taxid 81077, i.e. synthetic constructs and vectors, `_artificial` suffix), and combined (both natural and artificial, `_combined` suffix). The `prim_align_*` columns contain data extracted from the primary alignment record (not secondary or supplementary) in the aligner SAM output. Reads are clustered by species using VSEARCH, cluster representatives are BLASTed against the NCBI core_nt database, and validation results are propagated back to all reads in each cluster. Produced for both short-read and ONT platforms; paired-end-specific columns contain NA values for ONT.",
